        ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip
        microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The
        ESP32 series employs either a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in
        both dual-core and single-core variations, Xtensa LX7 dual-core
        microprocessor or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor and includes
        built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive
        amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and
        developed by Espressif Systems, a Chinese company based in Shanghai, and
        is manufactured by TSMC using their 40 nm process. It is a successor to
        the ESP8266 microcontroller.
